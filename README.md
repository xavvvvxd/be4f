# Better Events for Fabric

BE4F implements many common and useful events for other mods to
subscribe to. \
The goal of BE4F is to replicate [Minecraft Forge's](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge)
vast catalogue of events in Fabric. Specifically, all events available in Forge 1.16.5 will be implemented.

## Goals

- [ ] Replicate all client-side Minecraft Forge events
- [ ] Replicate all server-side Minecraft Forge events
- [ ] Allow mods to edit data through events
- [ ] Allow mods to cancel events
